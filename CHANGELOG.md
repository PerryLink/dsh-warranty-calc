# Changelog

## 0.2.3

- Rework the README first screen. The H1 now names what the plugin checks rather
  than repeating the package name, and a question-and-answer table and a standards
  table come before the boundary paragraph.

  The substance is unchanged and the boundary paragraph is verbatim: in a
  compliance tool that paragraph is what stops a wrong "pass" being read as
  approval, so it moved rather than shrank. What changed is the order - a reader
  or an extractor previously met eleven badges, an install command and a
  disclaimer before learning what the plugin does. The Q&A rows are derived from
  each plugin's own rules and the standards table from the rule pack's
  `document`/`number` fields, so no answer and no standard is hand-typed.

  All five languages were restructured together; `check:readmes` holds them to the
  same section count, install command and configuration keys.

## 0.2.2

- Ship `CHANGELOG.md` and `SECURITY.md` inside the package. `files` is an
  allowlist and neither was on it, so no release note had ever reached anyone
  who installed this package, and npm had no changelog section to show.
## 0.2.1

- Citation pass: every `excerpt` was checked against this repository's own
  `rules/evidence/` record, and the record was completed for the clauses the
  rules quote.
- Seven source URLs were broken by a duplicated path segment and could not be opened.
- Adds `rules/citations-baseline.json`, which the `check:citations` gate reads:
  it lists any excerpt not yet traceable to the evidence, and that list can
  only shrink.
## 0.2.0

- Release infrastructure brought to the family standard: `verify:self-contained`,
  `check:lockfile`, `check:readmes` and `check:citations` gates, a `prepublishOnly` that
  re-runs the whole chain, SECURITY.md, dependabot, and the OpenSSF Scorecard workflow.
- `check:citations` enforces the rule this pack's own header states: every `excerpt`
  must be a verbatim quotation, findable in `rules/evidence/`. Rules that are not
  traceable yet are listed in `rules/citations-baseline.json`, and that file can only
  shrink - anything new has to be sourced before it can land.
- The README install command now names the published package instead of a local tarball.
- Five-language READMEs hold the same section count and the same configuration keys.
- Rule pack: 7 rules across WC-001..WC-007.
- Licensed Apache-2.0.
